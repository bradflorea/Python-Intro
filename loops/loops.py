# num = 0

# while num <= 100:
#     if num == 50:
#         break
#     print(num)
#     num = num + 10

# print ('ALL DONE!')


## break will break out of the loop entirely





# target = 37
# guess = None

# while guess != target:
#     guess = input('What is your guess?')
#     if guess == 'exit':
#         break
#     guess = int(guess)

# print('You guessed it!')





# colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow']
# for color in colors:
#     print(color)

## for loop will iterate through a list, works like a for...of loop in javascript




# for char in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ':
#         print(char)

## prints each letter of the alphabet



# for num in 'abcde':
#     print('hello world')

## prints 'hello world' 5 times, once for each letter in 'abcde'
